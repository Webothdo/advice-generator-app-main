## My process
I first identified what I was tasked with building, then I broke it down into components. After I figured how I wanted it to be stacked
I built out the very minimum first - no css - nothing, just to hook up the API and played with making it work and changing the text
dynamically.

At this point, I was starting to get an idea of what direction I wanted to take - it was here I decided I wanted to add a save as image and share features.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned about css position and device height and width and how they affect elements in it all over again. Working with npm packages on a vanilla javascript
was new to me so I heard to learn modules and how to build code with parcel(there are other options like webpack).

Deploying it was also a really great experience as I had to do a lot of debugging as to why my website wasn't showing, did a few googling and figured it's because I needed to point to a different folder(a dist folder) after I built my website.


### Continued development

I would definitely look more into calling apis and rendering dynamic contents. It wouldn't hurt too if I take a bit of time
to work on how to optimise my css - making it as lean and as efficient as possible(that means having to implementing DRY code and writing saas?)


### Useful resources

I will be adding few resources that helped me
